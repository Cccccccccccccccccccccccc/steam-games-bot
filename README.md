# steam-games-bot

As it has come to my attention that a scammer had been reselling my bot, and had added backdoors to it, I am now releasing it for free.

Loading games into the bot can be done as it is described in the data/load/example.txt file, in this case, loading it into the bot would be done with !load example.txt

It is then loaded into the 2 files, unique.json and random.json, and example.txt should now be cleared or deleted.

All available commands can be displayed with !help, admin only commands will only be shown to admins.

Messages can be changed in the files commands.js and steam.js, anywhere that says steam.message or exports.message are messages that will be sent to users.

This bot is published under the MIT License, additional information can be found in LICENSE.md
